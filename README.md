### The challenge 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

###Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Combination of mobile-first/Desktop workflow

### What I learned

1. Understand the parts at play and how they work together.
2. Do a box model mark-up/drawing - it helped me to visualize the page, naming components & reduce complexity.
3. Though, I started with mobile-first workflow, there were sections that I swapped to desktop workflow. 
4. Learn by doing. As Samuel Snead "Practice puts brains in your muscles." 
5. I am not alone!!

### Continued development

For my next challenge, I would use SASS. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - this source helped to look for small snippets of code.
- [CodePen] (https://codepen.io/trending) - for Flexbox & Grid
